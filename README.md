This exercise is an attempt to Classify the famous rock vs mine dataset using various Binary Classifiers and Assess the prediction accuracy and Precision.
The Data Itself contains 59 dimensions corresponding to particular variables recorded by the sonar while scanning a region for mines, 208 instances of such 
datapoints are available to us with there corresponding type that is rock or mine being marked in the 60th dimension of the dataset. 

We first distribute the model in two parts namely the test and the train part due to reasons already discussed in previous projects, here this partition is done 
in a ratio of 9:1. Then various models are parametrized on the train set and tested on the test set.
